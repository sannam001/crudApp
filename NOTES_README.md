    We can use this for creating a back end server, just like tomcat server.

NPM: Node package manager

What is NPM ?
    It is a set of js files bundled together for achieving certain functionality and published in the 
    NPM. NPM is online repository for publishing open - source Node.Js projects, and command line utility for interacting with that repository
    for dependency mgmt, package installation and version management.
    Simply NPM consists of dependencies that has modules, and under the modules there are different written logics called functions() we can use them directly by importing the dependencies. 

How to check version of NPM & node ?
    npm --version
    node --version

Where does NPM save the reference of all the installed modules that we are using in the project?
    It will save in "package.json". Package.Json has all the details of installed dependencies.

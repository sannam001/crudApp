# Crud Application(Create, Read, Update, Delete)
I am learning from scratch how to build an application with react using crud , routing and environment set up

#### Command to add a remote branch:
<p>Below command helps to add a remote branch to your local</p>
git remote add <nameof the master repo> <url of the master repo>
  eg: git remote add upstream https://github.com/krishna63/crudApp.git

### Command to get latest code:
<p>Next you need to run the below command, that way you will get the latest code that is merged into 
the upstream</p>
  <p>git pull <name of the master repo> <name of the branch></p>
  <p>eg: git pull upstream master</p>

<p>Note: <strong>We need to run  the above command at regular intervals so that we always have the latest code in the master</strong></p>

Task:
<ol>
  <li> Create a new branch called notesAboutNPM</li>
  <li> Add a new file and name it NOTES_README.md file</li>
  <li> Start following the same practise for each of the tools/process we learn during our training activity.</li>
</ol>

# Crud Application(Create, Read, Update, Delete)
I am learning from scratch how to build an application with react using crud , routing and environment set up

#### Command to add a remote branch:
<p>Below command helps to add a remote branch to your local system:</p>
  <code>git remote add <nameof the master repo> <url of the master repo></code><br>
  <code>Eg: git remote add upstream https://github.com/krishna63/crudApp.git<code>

#### Command to fetch the latest code:
<p>Next you need to run the below command:</p>
  <code>git pull <name of the master repo> <name of the branch></code>
  <code>Eg: git pull upstream master</code>

<p>Note: <strong>We need to run  the above command at regular intervals so that we always have the latest code in the master.</strong></p>

<u>Task</u>:
<ol>
  <li> Create a new branch called notesAboutNPM</li>
  <li> Add a new file and name it NOTES_README.md file</li>
  <li> Start following the same practise for each of the tools/process we learn during our training activity.</li>
</ol>
